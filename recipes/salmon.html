        <h2>Salmon is a favorite of mine. This recipe never fails to be a hit, whether we broil the salmon in the oven or grill it outdoors. Pair it with some homemade teriyaki fried rice to complete your meal.</h2>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup sesame oil</li>
                <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tbsp brown sugar, more or less to taste</li>
                <li>1 tbsp sesame seeds</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground mustard</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground ginger</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>4 (6 oz) salmon steaks</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix sesame oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame seeds, ground mustard, ginger, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Set aside 1/2 cup of marinade for basting.</li>
                <li>Pour remaining marinade into a resealable plastic bag and place salmon into the marinade. Squeeze air out of the bag, seal, and marinate the salmon steaks for at least 1 hour (2 hours for better flavor). Drain and discard used marinade.</li>
                <li>Set oven rack about 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place salmon steaks into a broiler pan and broil for 5 minutes. Brush steaks with reserved marinade, turn, and broil until fish is opaque and flakes easily, about 5 more minutes. Brush again with marinade.</li>
